"""`make speaking-items`: pick the practice sentences from the trimmed corpus (ADR-0006).

A sentence is a slice of one line of a passage's trimmed `text`, unchanged, with the offsets that
find it again. It pins the `Source._id` it came from (ADR-0010) and carries the expected phonemes
from G2P, so the API never recomputes them. Runs in the speech service's environment (G2P), so
the imports of `sonari_speech` are inside `main`.
